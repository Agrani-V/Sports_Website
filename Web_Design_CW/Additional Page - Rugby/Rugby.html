          Currently, rugby is a team sport played by two teams, with each team comprising of 15 players. The objective
          of the game is to score points by carrying the ball over the opponent's goal line or by kicking the ball
          through their goalposts. Players are free to carry, pass, or kick the ball, while the opposing team endeavors
          to halt their progress by tackling the ball carrier or trying to intercept the ball. It is important to note
          that rugby is renowned for its physically demanding nature and necessitates a high level of fitness and skill
          from players. To ensure player safety, protective gear such as mouthguards, headgear, and padded clothing are
          used. Rugby is a beloved sport played at both amateur and professional levels, relished by millions of
          individuals around the world.

        <p>The roots of rugby can be traced back to the early 19th century, where football (soccer) was all the rage in
          England. However, in 1823, during a game of football at the Rugby School in England, a young chap by the name
          of William Webb Ellis picked up the ball and did the unthinkable - he ran with it, blatantly breaking the
          rules of the game. This unorthodox move is said to be the impetus that gave birth to rugby, a novel sport that
          blended elements from football and other games. The inaugural official rules of rugby were established by the
          Rugby School in 1845, and from that moment on, the sport began to garner popularity not only in England but
          also in other parts of the world.
